README
======
A. This package includes the following files:

|-- sched.py [as requested in assignment]
|-- processes.csv [as requested in assignment]
|-- run.sh [build script]
|-- README.txt [This file]


B. Use your designed makefile:
To compile the code and build the executable using the command 
systemprompt>  make
// or make Starter

To remove the  executable files use

systemprompt>  make clean

To run the program use

systemprompt> ./Starter

C. Answer the following questions (1 point each, select/type the right answer).

1. What is the other name for Shortest Job First Preemptive Algorithm?
  Shortest Remaining Time First.

2. What are the 5 different states a process can be in scheduling (Look into process state diagram)?
  New, Ready, Running, Wait and Complete.

3. Shortest Job First is like Priority Scheduling with the priority based on ______ of the process?
  length of burst (burst time)

4. CONVOY effect is the primary disadvantage of First Come First Serve Scheduling algorithm.

5. How does Multi Level Feedback queue prevent starvation of processes that waits too long in lower priority queue?
  It can prevent starvation by moving the process that waits too long from a lower to a hihher priority queue.

  BUG REPORT:
  The assignemt results seem to sort by process ID and not by the order of input file, which is concievably arrival order.
  This causes process 2 to be selected ahead of process 3 in FCFS.
  I have implemented both the buggy (as in the assignemt) and the correct versions.
  To run the corrected version uncomment line with comment 'correct version' at the end
  and comment the next line.
